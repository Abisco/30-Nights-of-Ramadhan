# 30 Nights of Ramadan
30 Nights of Ramadan is a passion project made to post poems and pieces on the holy month of Ramadan. The website was created using the Agency bootstrap theme. The project was completed in 2015 and has not been updated since.The database was taken offline recently, so you can't really view any poems and pieces, but the code here should be enough to give an idea of how it all worked.

## Issues
- Code is not Sanitized
- Website is very inefficient (and slow)
- Database is offline and deprecated calls are used.
